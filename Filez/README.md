Please go to the SDRPlay website, and download a Linux API distributable from there.
I cannot automatise this operation due to a CAPTCHA.
And then put it into this directory so that playbooks can access it and upload onto targets.

The filenames are such:
SDRplay_RSP_API-Linux-2.11.1.run

SDRplay_RSP_API-Linux-2.13.1.run

SDRplay_RSP_API-Linux-3.01.beta1.run

However, use the middle on in scripts because the latest has yet no support.

In case you haven't discovered it yet, 
make a copy of the distributable,
open it with a good text editor (like vim),
erase all readable lines so that only the binary blob remains,
save it, remain to a .tgz file,
and enjoy the content.
