Please go to the SDRPlay website, and download a Linux API distributable from there.
I cannot automatise this operation due to a CAPTCHA.
And then put it into this directory so that playbooks can access it and upload onto targets.

The filenames are such:
SDRplay_RSP_API-Linux-2.13.1.run
SDRplay_RSP_API-Linux-3.01.beta1.run

However, use the first one in scripts because the latest has yet no support.
